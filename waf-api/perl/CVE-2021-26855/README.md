# Mitigate CVE-2021-26855

This is a script that provides a first line of defence against the recent Microsoft Exchange Server SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855: HAFNIUM group). The script would create the required configuration on the OWA security policy of the WAF and will impact applications that are currently using the policy.

How to run the script: 

`perl mitigate_CVE_2021_26855.pl <WAF IP> <WAF port> <REST login username> <password>`

Make sure perl is installed on the device you are running the script from and the WAF IP:Port is reachable. The login credentials indicate the username and password used to administer the WAF. The script works on all WAF firmware versions running 9.2.0 and above.

For example:

`perl /tmp/mitigate_CVE_2021_26855.pl 1.1.1.1 8000 admin password`
